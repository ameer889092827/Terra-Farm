### PROCESS: Planting Corn
When you plant corn in NASA Data Farm, here's what happens beneath the surface:

**1. Germination Begins** (0-3 days)
   - The seed absorbs water (imbibition), swelling to 1.5x its size.
   - Enzymes activate, converting stored starch to sugar for energy.
   - **NASA Data Check:** Soil moisture should be 60-70% for optimal germination.
   
**2. Root Emergence** (3-5 days)
   - The radicle (primary root) breaks through the seed coat.
   - Root hairs develop, increasing water absorption by 500x.
   - **üõ∞Ô∏è Satellite Insight:** Soil temperature above 10¬∞C (50¬∞F) is needed.

**üí° Pro Tip:** Watch NDVI values - they'll stay near 0.1-0.2 during germination but jump to 0.3+ once leaves emerge!
